## They Are Billions Custom Hotkeys
Quick macros to make a "Grid layout" hotkey scheme for They Are Billions while we wait for them to make proper hotkeys.
Here are the default hotkeys
[default-CC](/default-CC.png)
[unit-hotkey](/unit-hotkey.png)
And is the new grid layout:
[default-blank](/default-blank.png)

The hotkey locations are based on 1080p full screen window size.
